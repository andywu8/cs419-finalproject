Assessment of the assignment:
This assignment helped us to learn how to create a server interface on the web using Flask and HTML. This made us realize how large scale websites like Facebook or Amazon are built and customize pages for each user. By retrieving data from the server, we were able to plug this into the Flask templates. This allowed for us to have modular code that was able to adapt depending on the data required by the user. 


This assignment helped us to learn how to properly use a server to communicate data across a network. We realized how sockets made it very easy to send and store data across networks. This assignment was a bit difficult because we ran into issues with Github. Thus, we ran into version issues which were very hard to resolve and made us keep running into bugs on our machines. We learned how to build out a GUI in Python in Pyside6. Before, we had only used TKinter in Object Oriented Programming. This was a good introduction to building out the GUI.



Pylint:
Our pylint score is low because of PySide import errors and importing table.
These errors were out of our control. We also have pylint errors becuase we have
alot of class variables in the MainWindow class. However, we actually do want these
class variables instead of breaking it into multiple classes. As a result we think
that its fine to have more class variables.
